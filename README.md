# JWEAR APP

This is an app inspired on a project that i did on class, was a fictional clothing brand, and in the beggining I made it with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Now I will try to do the same but with React-Native and Tailwind, and if i can i will have a connection to a database to search for the photos, and to be able to do the log in.

## Programming Languages

In this ocassion i will use React-Native and Tailwind, because my intention is to do a mobile application.

And for the Backend I will use FastAPI with Python to do the connection with the database.

## Database

I will use a platform named Aiven, that offers free databases with a free plan, and i will create a MySQL database to store the photos and to be able to do the log in.
